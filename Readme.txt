 *Two codin .py files for question1 and question 2 respectivily
 *I have put two files showing the image of the result of the question 2
 *One give the value of inverse other the value of joint angles
 







############ FOR QUESTION 1# ###########################
*The first code use the following variables to get the graph plotted
*Enter angle values in radians
*x_initial=3,y_initial=4,Theta_initial=1.047,steering angle=.23
*angular velocity=1

############# FOR QUESTION 2# ##########################
*Sympy is used to create symbols and use mathematics operations
*postion equation was calculated by hand and put in the code
*velcoity for calcuated by hand and put in the code
*inverse was found out to calcuate joint angle velocity
